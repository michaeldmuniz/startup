# ThriftConnect

[My Notes](notes.md)

ThriftConnect is my innovative app that enhances the thrifting experience by leveraging technology to connect buyers and sellers of pre-loved clothing. It features real-time chat capabilities, allowing users to communicate directly and efficiently. This streamlines the process of coordinating transactions and inquiries, simplifying the interaction between parties. By connecting eco-conscious fashion enthusiasts with a diverse array of unique and affordable clothing options, ThriftConnect supports a sustainable fashion community, making eco-friendly shopping both accessible and enjoyable.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will structure the user interface with HTML, designing pages for browsing items, uploading clothing listings, managing user accounts, and real-time chat windows.
- **CSS** - I will use CSS for styling, ensuring the design is visually appealing and user-friendly, with a focus on mobile-first design to accommodate on-the-go thrift shoppers.
- **React** - I will use React to build a dynamic and responsive user interface, manage application state and routing for a seamless single-page experience, integrate with real-time data for features like chat
- **Service** - I will Integrate third-party APIs for additional functionalities, exploring APIs such as Good On You or EcoChain for trend analysis to suggest popular and environmentally sustainable items. Additionally, maybe community engagement tools that might leverage forums or discussion board APIs to enhance user interaction and support local fashion communities. And I will Develop web services to handle actions such as posting new listings, updating user profiles, and processing transactions securely.
- **DB/Login** - I will Utilize a database to store user data, item listings, transaction histories, and chats.
- **WebSocket** - I will Implement web sockets to facilitate real-time interactions used for real-time chat between buyers and sellers and notifications about new listings or price drops.
