# ThriftConnect

[My Notes](notes.md)

ThriftConnect is my innovative app that enhances the thrifting experience by leveraging technology to connect buyers and sellers of pre-loved clothing. It features real-time chat capabilities, allowing users to communicate directly and efficiently. This streamlines the process of coordinating transactions and inquiries, simplifying the interaction between parties.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will structure the user interface with HTML, designing pages for browsing items, uploading clothing listings, managing user accounts, and real-time chat windows.
- **CSS** - I will use CSS for styling, ensuring the design is visually appealing and user-friendly, with a focus on mobile-first design to accommodate on-the-go thrift shoppers.
- **React** - I will use React to build a dynamic and responsive user interface, manage application state and routing for a seamless single-page experience, integrate with real-time data for features like chat
- **Service** - I will Integrate third-party APIs for additional functionalities, exploring APIs such as Good On You or EcoChain for trend analysis to suggest popular and environmentally sustainable items. Additionally, maybe community engagement tools that might leverage forums or discussion board APIs to enhance user interaction and support local fashion communities. And I will Develop web services to handle actions such as posting new listings and updating user profiles.
- **DB/Login** - I will Utilize a database to store user data, item listings, transaction histories, and chats.
